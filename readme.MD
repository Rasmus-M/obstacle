# Bouncy's obstacle course

An original game for the TI-99/4A home computer (1981) developed January - April 2019.

## Building the game

The xdt99 cross-development tools are required to build the game.
See https://github.com/endlos99/xdt99

Java is required to build the cartridge version.

On Windows, run make.bat to build the cartridge, or makedisk to build the disk version.

## Running the game

There are 2 options for running the game:

* With 16K cartridge, FinalGROM99, or emulators: Burn and run obstacle-8.bin (non-inverted) or obstacle-9.bin (inverted).
* TODO: With 32K expansion and disk system: Run E/A#5 DSK1.OBSTACLE1.

## Playing the game
You can play the game using a joystick (left, right, fire) or keyboard (s, d, space), depending on which key you press to start the game.

Press S on the start screen to turn speech on/off.

## License

The code and game is free to use for non-commercial purposes. You are not allowed to sell this game without my permission.
